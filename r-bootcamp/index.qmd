A compact course to take you from zero to R-hero! 

The course involves a series of self-paced lessons, see the list below. At the end of each lesson, you will find a list of recommended activities and readings, which you are warmly encouraged to complete. 

A tip: make sure to type along the code you see, rather than simply reading it and thinking "oh I understand it, hence I can surely do it without guidance". Programming is learnt by doing.
