A compact course to take you from zero to R-hero! The list of self-paced lessons is as follows. Each lesson includes, at the end, a series of suggested activities and readings which you are warmly encouraged to complete. Finally, as a tip, make sure to type along the code you see, rather than simply reading it and thinking "oh I understand it, hence I can surely do it without guidance."
