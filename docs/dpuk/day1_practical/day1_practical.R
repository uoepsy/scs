# Vectors
# =======

# Create a vector with the c (short for combine) function
c(1, 3, 5)
c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

# sequence from 1 to 10
seq(10, 15)
seq(10, 15, by = 1)

# from:to is a short for seq(from, to, by = 1)
10:15

# you can combine vectors
c(1:4, 10)

# in steps of 2
seq(1, 10, by = 2)

# five equally spaced numbers
seq(0, 10, length.out = 5)


# Assign variables / objects
# ==========================

# Variable = named cell of the computer's memory that can store different values

# Assign = store the result of a computation into a variable

# To assign the result of a computation to a variable, use the assignment 
# operator <-

# What will R print?
a <- 1:5

# Subsetting / indexing
# =====================

# Numeric indexing:
#   Specify the elements you want within square brackets []
#   positive integer = keep
#   negative integer = exclude

# Logical indexing:
#   TRUE = keep, FALSE = exclude
#   Must provide as many TRUE/FALSE(s) as the length of the variable.

# Reading data
# ============

# Hypothetical study into the recovery of stroke patients. 
# We have 32 patients who suffered strokes. The severity of the stroke was recorded, along with whether the left or right side of the brain was affected. 
# 2 weeks following the stroke, patients' recovery was measured with the "Timed Up & Go" test - a measure of physical functioning. We also have data on the number of hours spent in physiotherapy over the 2 week period. 

# The attributes include:
#   physio: Hours spent in physiotherapy over 2 weeks
#   TUG: Timed Up & Go test (lower scores indicate better physical functioning)
#   NIHSS: NIH Stroke Severity Scale (higher values indicate more severe stroke)
#   side: Side of the brain affected
#   Leftside: Dummy coded variable (0 = Right-side, 1 = Left-side)
#   hosp: Hospital patient was admitted at

    labs(x = "Physiotherapy (Hours)", 
       y = "Timed Up & Go Test (seconds)")

    geom_density() +
    facet_grid(~ side)


# Practice
# ===============

# 1. Locate the path to the stroke data on the shared folder. 
# Read the data into R using that path and perform some exploratory data analysis.

# 2. Outcome variable = TUG, explanatory variable = physio. 
# Fit a linear model that uses the explanatory variable to predict the outcome.

# 3. Write down an interpretation of the model results. This typically includes a
# few sentences about the coefficients.

# 4. Create a plot of the fitted line. 
#    Hint: geom_abline(intercept = ?, slope = ?)
