## Start here

This is a short course on linear models using the R programming language.

Each day will comprise a 1 hour lecture in the morning, and a practical in the afternoon.

Before starting, please make sure you are able to access RStudio on the DPUK Research platform. During the training event you will be primarily working on the research platform.

If you wish to install RStudio locally on your own laptop, you can find detailed instructions at [this link](install-update-r.html). However, you won't have access to the DPUK data outside of the DPUK research platform.
