## Introduction to R and RStudio

RStudio Panes and Interface

- **Console:** Execute commands interactively. To execute code, press Enter.
- **Editor:** Write, modify, and save your R code. Press `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter` to send code to the Console for execution.
- **Environment:** View your current objects and variables.
- **Files, Plots, Packages, and Help:** Access your files, see your plots, and access the help page. Install/update packages (more on this later).

Console vs R scripts vs Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files

- **Console:** The Console is used for running commands interactively. It is great for quick calculations or testing small pieces of code, but it does not save your work. Once you close RStudio, the commands in the Console are lost unless explicitly saved elsewhere.
- **R Scripts (.R files):** R scripts are plain text files where you can write and save R code. They are ideal for creating reusable code and documenting your workflow. You can execute code from an R script by sending it to the Console (e.g., using `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter`).
- **RMarkdown (.Rmd files):** RMarkdown files combine code, text, and output in a single document. They are used for creating dynamic reports, presentations, or documents that include both analysis and narrative. You can execute code chunks within an RMarkdown file and render the document into formats like HTML, PDF, or Word.

Code vs Comments (vs Text in Rmarkdown)

- **Code:** Code is the actual R commands that are executed to perform tasks. In R scripts, code is written directly in the file. In RMarkdown, code is written inside code chunks (e.g., ` ```{r} ... ``` `).

- **Text in RMarkdown:** In RMarkdown, text outside of code chunks is treated as narrative or explanatory text. It is written in Markdown syntax and is used to provide context, explanations, or documentation alongside the code and its output.

- **Comments:** Comments are lines of text in R scripts (or in RMarkdown code chunks) that are not executed as code. They are used to explain or document the code. In R, comments start with `#`. For example:
  ```r
  # This is a comment
  x <- 5  # Assign 5 to x
  ```

## Basic R Functionality

### Arithmetic and Calculations

R can perform basic arithmetic operations. Here are some examples:

```{r}
1 + 2   # Addition
5 - 3   # Subtraction
2 * 3   # Multiplication
1 / 2   # Division

# Exponentiation
2^3
# Square roots
sqrt(4)
9^(1/2)

# Standard functions such as log(), exp(), log10() also exist
```

Remember, order of operations matters! Use parentheses to ensure the correct order.

```{r}
# This will give different results
(1 + 2) * 3   # Parentheses first
1 + 2 * 3     # Multiplication first
```

---

### Getting help in R

```r
?sqrt
help(sqrt)
```
---

### Logical values

```{r}
# Logical
TRUE
FALSE
!TRUE             # not operator
2 == 3            # equal to operator
2 != 2            # not equal to operator
!(2 == 2)
2 > 3
2 <= 3
(2 > 1) & (2 < 3) # and operator
(2 > 1) | (2 < 3) # or operator
```

---

### Variables and Assignment

Variables are used to store values. 

Use `<-` or `=` for assignment into a name. 

You can later retrieve the value by calling the variable name.

```{r}
x <- 5          # Assign 5 to x
y <- 10         # Assign 10 to y
total <- x + y  # Add x and y
total           # Output 15
```

---

## Vectors

Vectors are one-dimensional arrays that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. You can create vectors using the combine function, `c()`.

```{r}
# Creating a numeric vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Creating a character vector
characters <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Creating a logical vector
logicals <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Accessing elements of a vector
numbers[1]       # First element
characters[2:3]  # Second and third elements
logicals[c(1, 3)] # First and third elements

# Vectorized operations
numbers * 2       # Multiply each element by 2
numbers + 10      # Add 10 to each element
numbers > 3       # Logical comparison

# Member of a vector
"cherry" %in% characters
```

---

## Installing packages

In console:

````r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
install.packages("tidyverse")
````

Using the Packages tab in RStudio.

---

## Introduction to tidyverse

This is a brief overview of tidyverse, the set of packages for data science in R.

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse collection of packages
library(tidyverse)
```

`tidyverse` is a collection of packages which includes:

- `ggplot2` for data visualization
- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- `tidyr` for data tidying
- `readr` for data import
- `tibble` for data frames
- `stringr` for string manipulation
- `forcats` for categorical variables

and more... 

The good news is: you don't need to remember which package a function comes from. 
When you load the tidyverse, all of these packages are loaded at once.

You can find helpful cheatsheets [here](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/).

## palmerpenguins: A tidyverse data example

A demonstration using the `penguins` dataset, provided by the [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html).

The `penguins` dataset contains 344 rows and 8 variables:

- `species` - a factor denoting penguin species (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
- `island` - a factor denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)
- `bill_length_mm` - a number denoting bill length (millimeters)
- `bill_depth_mm` - a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)
- `flipper_length_mm` - an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)
- `body_mass_g` - an integer denoting body mass (grams)
- `sex` - a factor denoting penguin sex (female, male)
- `year` - an integer denoting the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

# Look at the first six rows of the dataset
head(penguins)

# Structure of dataset
str(penguins)

# Summary of dataset
summary(penguins)

# A scatterplot exploring penguin body mass vs flipper length
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Penguins: Flipper Length vs Body Mass",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")

# A boxplot to explore the association between body mass and species
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Penguins: Body Mass by Species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

---

## Data subsetting

````r
penguins[1, ]           # First row

penguins[, 1]           # First column - by number
penguins[ , "species"]  # First column - by name
penguins$species        # First column - by name

penguins[c(1,2,3), ]    # First three rows

penguins[, c(1,2,3)]    # First three columns - by number
penguins[, c("species", "island", "bill_length_mm")] # First three columns - by name

penguins[c(1,2,3), c(1,2,3)] # First three rows and columns and range shortcut
penguins[1:3, 1:3] # Shortcut : for range of consecutive values
````

````r
# Subset the data for only Adelie species
adelie_penguins <- penguins |> 
  filter(species == "Adelie")

# Remove specific rows of the penguins dataset
!is.na(penguins$body_mass_g)    # returns TRUE/FALSE for each row

# Filter out rows with NA values in body_mass_g
penguins_no_na <- penguins |> 
  filter( !is.na(body_mass_g) )

# Only keep columns species, body_mass_g
penguins_subset <- penguins_no_na |> 
  select(species, body_mass_g)
````

## Reading data into R

Consider [this dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv)

A file path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in your computer's file system. It tells your system how to navigate through folders to locate the file. There are two main types:

**Absolute Path:** Specifies the complete directory list from the root folder.

**Relative Path:** Specifies the location relative to the current file or folder.

Paths are essential for accessing or referencing files correctly in your code.

````r
# Read from local file
penguins_data <- read_csv("path/to/penguins.csv")

# Read from URL
penguins_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv")
````

The following functions are also available to read other types of files:

- `read_csv()` for CSV files
- `read_tsv()` for tab-separated files
- `read_excel()` for Excel files
- `library(haven)` and then
  - `read_dta()` for Stata files
  - `read_sav()` for SPSS files
  - `read_sas()` for SAS files
