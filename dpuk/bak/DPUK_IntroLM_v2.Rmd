# What is a model?
+ Pretty much all statistics is about models.

+ A model is an idea about the way the world is.
  + A formal representation of a system or relationships

+ Typically we represent models as functions.
  + We input data
  + Specify a set of relationships
  + We output a prediction

---
# An Example
+ To think through these relations, we can use a simple example.

+ Suppose I have a model for growth of babies.<sup>1</sup>

$$
Length = 55 + 4 * Month
$$

.footnote[
[1] Length is measured in cm.

# How good is my model?
+ How might we judge how good our model is?

  1. Model is represented as a function
  
  2. We see that as a line (or surface if we have more things to consider)
  
  3. That yields predictions (or values we expect if our model is true)
  
  4. We can collect data
  
  5. If the predictions do not match the data (points deviate from our line), that says something about our model.



---
# Linear model
+ The linear model is the workhorse of statistics.

+ When using a linear model, we are typically trying to explain variation in an **outcome** (Y, dependent, response) variable, using one or more **predictor** (x, independent, explanatory) variable(s).


---
# Example

**Simple data**

+ `student` = ID variable unique to each respondent

+ `hours` = the number of hours spent studying. This will be our predictor ( $x$ )

# How to find a line?
+ The line represents a model of our data.
  + In our example, the model that best characterizes the relationship between hours of study and test score.

+ In the scatterplot, the data is represented by points.

+ So a good line, is a line that is "close" to all points.


---
# Linear Model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$


+ $y_i$ = the outcome variable (e.g. `score`) 

+ $x_i$ = the predictor variable, (e.g. `hours`)

+ $\beta_0$ = intercept

+ $\beta_1$ = slope

+ $\epsilon_i$ = residual (we will come to this shortly)

where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma)$ independently.
  + $\sigma$ = standard deviation (spread) of the errors
  + The standard deviation of the errors, $\sigma$, is constant


---
# Linear Model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$

+ **Why do we have $i$ in some places and not others?**


--

+ $i$ is a subscript to indicate that each participant has their own value.

+ So each participant has their own: 
    + score on the test ( $y_i$ )
    + number of hours studied ( $x_i$ ) and
    + residual term ( $\epsilon_i$ )

--
+ **What does it mean that the intercept ( $\beta_0$ ) and slope ( $\beta_1$ ) do not have the subscript $i$?**

--

+ It means there is one value for all observations.
    + Remember the model is for **all of our data**

---
# What is $\epsilon_i$?

.pull-left[
+ $\epsilon_i$, or the residual, is a measure of how well the model fits each data point.

+ It is the distance between the model line (on $y$-axis) and a data point.

+ $\epsilon_i$ is positive if the point is above the line (red in plot)

+ $\epsilon_i$ is negative if the point is below the line (blue in plot)

# Principle of least squares

+ The numbers $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are typically **unknown** and need to be estimated in order to fit a line through the point cloud.

+ We denote the "best" values as $\hat \beta_0$ and $\hat \beta_1$

+ The best fitting line is found using **least squares**
    + Minimizes the distances between the actual values of $y$ and the model-predicted values of $\hat y$
    + Specifically minimizes the sum of the *squared* deviations

---
# Principle of least squares

+ Actual value = $y_i$

+ Model-predicted value = $\hat y_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i$

+ Deviation or residual = $y_i - \hat y_i$

+ Minimize the **residual sum of squares**, $SS_{Residual}$, which is

$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i - (\hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_{i})]^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

---
# Data, predicted values and residuals

+ Data = $y_i$
    + This is what we have measured in our study. 
    + For us, the test scores.

+ Predicted value = $\hat{y}_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i$ = the y-value on the line at specific values of $x$
    + Or, the value of the outcome our model predicts given someone's values for predictors.
    + In our example, given you study for 4 hrs, what test score does our model predict you will get.

+ Residual = Difference between $y_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$. So;

$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

???

# Interpretation

+ **Slope is the number of units by which Y increases, on average, for a unit increase in X.**

--
    + Unit of Y = 1 point on the test
    + Unit of X = 1 hour of study
    
--

+ So, for every hour of study, test score increases on average by 1.055 points.

--

+ **Intercept is the expected value of Y when X is 0.**

--

    + X = 0 is a student who does not study.

--

+ So, a student who does no study would be expected to score 0.40 on the test.

???
+ So we know in a general sense what the intercept and slope are, but what do they mean with respect to our data and question?

---
# Note of caution on intercepts
+ In our example, 0 has a meaning.
    + It is a student who has studied for 0 hours.
  + But it is not always the case that 0 is meaningful.

+ Suppose our predictor variable was not hours of study, but age.

+ **A person of 0 age has a test score of 0.40.**

---
# Unstandardized vs standardized coefficients
- In this example, we have unstandardized $\hat \beta_1$.

+ We interpreted the slope as the change in $y$ units for a unit change in $x$
  + Where the unit is determined by how we have measured our variables.

+ However, sometimes we may want to represent our results in standard units.
  + If the scales of our variables are arbitrary.
  + If we want to compare the effects of variables on different scales.


---
# Standardized results
+ We can either...

+ Standardized coefficients: 

$$\hat{\beta_1^*} = \hat \beta_1 \frac{s_x}{s_y}$$

+ where;
  + $\hat{\beta_1^*}$ = standardized beta coefficient
  + $\hat \beta_1$ = unstandardized beta coefficient
  + $s_x$ = standard deviation of $x$
  + $s_y$ = standard deviation of $y$

---
# Standardizing the variables

+ Alternatively, for continuous variables, transforming both the IV and DV to $z$-scores (mean=0, SD=1) prior to fitting the model yields standardised betas.

+ $z$-score for $x$:

$$z_{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}$$

+ and the $z$-score for $y$:

$$z_{y_i} = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}$$

+ That is, we divide the individual deviations from the mean by the standard deviation

---
# `lm()` using z-scores

```{r}
test <- test %>%
  mutate(
    z_score = scale(score, center = T, scale = T),
    z_hours = scale(hours, center = T, scale = T)
  )

res_z <- lm(z_score ~ z_hours, data = test)
summary(res_z)$coefficients
```


---
#  Interpreting standardized regression coefficients  

+ $b_0$ (intercept) = zero when all variables are standardized:

+ The interpretation of the coefficients becomes the increase in $y$ in standard deviation units for every standard deviation increase in $x$

+ So, in our example:

>**For every standard deviation increase in hours of study, test score increases by 0.72 standard deviations**

---
# Relationship to r
+ Standardized slope ( $\hat \beta_1^*$ ) = correlation coefficient ( $r$ ) for a linear model with a single continuous predictor.

+ In our example, $\hat \beta_{hours}^*$ = 0.72

```{r}
cor(test$hours, test$score)
```

+ $r$ is a standardized measure of linear association

+ $\hat \beta_1^*$ is a standardized measure of the linear slope.

#  Linear model with more predictors (multiple regression)
+ The aim of a linear model is to explain variance in an outcome.

+ In simple linear models, we have a single predictor, but the model can accommodate (in principle) any number of predictors. 

+ However, when we include multiple predictors, those predictors are likely to correlate

+ Thus, a linear model with multiple predictors finds the optimal prediction of the outcome from several predictors, **taking into account their redundancy with one another**


---
#  Uses of multiple regression 
+ **For prediction:** multiple predictors may lead to improved prediction. 

+ **For theory testing:** often our theories suggest that multiple variables together contribute to variation in an outcome

+ **For covariate control:** we might want to assess the effect of a specific predictor, controlling for the influence of others.
	+ E.g., effects of personality on health after removing the effects of age and sex


---
#  Extending the regression model 

+ Our model for a single predictor:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \epsilon_i$$ 

+ is extended to include additional $x$'s:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_3 x_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$  

+ For each $x$, we have an additional $\beta$
  + $\beta_1$ is the coefficient for the 1st predictor
  + $\beta_2$ for the second etc.

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_j x_{ji} + \epsilon_i$$

+ Given that we have additional variables, our interpretation of the regression coefficients changes a little

+ $\beta_0$ = the predicted value for $y$ **all** $x$ are 0.
	
+ Each $\beta_j$ is now a **partial regression coefficient**
	+ It captures the change in $y$ for a one unit change in , $x$ **when all other x's are held constant**

+ What does holding constant mean? 
  + Refers to finding the effect of the predictor when the values of the other predictors are fixed
		+ It may also be expressed as the effect of **controlling for**, or **partialling out**, or **residualizing for** the other $x$'s

+ With multiple predictors `lm` isolates the effects and estimates the unique contributions of predictors.

+ When we have a categorical variable with 2+ levels, we will typically assign integers

+ For example: What city do you live in?
  + 1 = Edinburgh; 2 = Glasgow, 3 = Birmingham etc.
  + Note these numbers are not meaningful, they just denote groups

+ When analysing a categorical predictor with $k$ levels, we need to take an additional step.

+ This step involves applying a coding scheme, where by each regressor = a difference in means between levels, or sets of levels.

+ There are lots of coding schemes.
  + We will just look at dummy coding (R default)

---
#  Dummy coding 
+ Dummy coding uses 0's and 1's to represent group membership
	+ One level is chosen as a baseline
	+ All other levels are compared against that baseline
	
+ Notice, this is identical to binary variables already discussed.

+ Dummy coding is simply the process of producing a set of binary coded variables

+ For any categorical variable, we will create $k$-1 dummy variables
  + $k$ = number of levels

#  Evaluating individual predictors 
+ Steps in hypothesis testing:

--
  + Research questions
    
--
  
  + Statistical hypothesis
    
--
  
  + Define the null
    
--
  
  + Calculate an estimate of effect of interest.
  
--
  
  + Calculate an appropriate test statistic.
    
--
  
  + Evaluate the test statistic against the null.
    

---
# Research question and hypotheses

+ **Statistical hypotheses** are testable mathematical statements.

+ In typical testing in Psychology, we define have a **null ( $H_0$ )** and an **alternative ( $H_1$ )** hypothesis.

+ $H_0$ is precise, and states a specific value for the effect of interest.

+ $H_1$ is not specific, and simply says "something else other than the null is more likely"


---
# Defining null

+ Conceptually:
	+ If $x$ yields no information on $y$, then $\beta_1 = 0$
	
+ **Why would this be the case?**

--
	+ $\beta$ gives the predicted change in $y$ for a unit change in $x$.
	+ If $x$ and $y$ are unrelated, then a change in $x$ will not result in any change to the predicted value of $y$
	+ So for a unit change in $x$, there is no (=0) change in $y$.
	
+ We can state this formally as a null and alternative:

$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$$
$$H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0$$


---
# Point estimate and test statistic

+ We have already discussed $\hat \beta_1$.

+ The associated test statistic to for $\beta$ coefficients is a $t$-statistic

$$t = \frac{\hat \beta}{SE(\hat \beta)}$$

+ where

  + $\hat \beta$ = any beta coefficient we have calculated
  + $SE(\hat \beta)$ = standard error of $\beta$ 

+ The standard error (SE) provides a measure of sampling variability
  + Smaller SE's suggest more precise estimate (=good)
  + For details on the calculation of $SE(\hat \beta)$ , see linked material.


---
# Back to the example

```{r}
summary(res_multi)
```


---
# Sampling distribution for the null

+ Now we have our $t$-statistic, we need to evaluate it.

+ For that, we need sampling distribution for the null.

+ For $\beta$, this is a $t$-distribution with $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom.
	+ Where $k$ is the number of predictors, and the additional -1 represents the intercept.

--

+ So for our model above, we have 3 predictors, and n = 100 
  + this is $n-k-1$ = $100-3-1$

#  Quality of the overall model 
+ When we measure an outcome ( $y$ ) in some data, the scores will vary (we hope).
  + Variation in $y$ = total variation of interest.

--

+ The aim of our linear model is to build a model which describes $y$ as a function of $x$.
	+ That is we are trying to explain variation in $y$ using $x$.

--

+ But it won't explain it all.
  + What is left unexplained is called the residual variance.

--

+ So we can breakdown variation in our data based on sums of squares as;

$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Model} + SS_{Residual}$$

---
#  Coefficient of determination 
+ One way to consider how good our model is, would be to consider the proportion of total variance our model accounts for. 

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}$$

+ $R^2$ = coefficient of determination

--

  + Quantifies the amount of variability in the outcome accounted for by the predictors.
  + More variance accounted for, the better.
  + Represents the extent to which the prediction of $y$ is improved when predictions are based on the linear relation between $x$ and $y$.

#  Adjusted $R^2$ 
+ We can also compute an adjusted $R^2$ when our lm has 2+ predictors.
  + $R^2$ is an inflated estimate of the corresponding population value

+ Due to random sampling fluctuation, even when $R^2 = 0$ in the population, it's value in the sample may $\neq 0$ 

+ In **smaller samples** , the fluctuations from zero will be larger on average

+ With **more IVs** , there are more opportunities to add to the positive fluctuation

#  Significance of the overall model 
+ The test of the individual predictors (IVs, or $x$'s) does not tell us if the overall model is significant or not.
	+ Neither does R-square
	+ But both are indicative

+ To test the significance of the model as a whole, we conduct an $F$-test.

---
#  F-ratio
+ $F$-ratio tests the null hypothesis that all the regression slopes in a model are all zero

+ $F$-ratio is a ratio of the explained to unexplained variance:

$$F = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}}$$

+ Where MS = mean squares

--

+ **What are mean squares?**
  + Mean squares are sums of squares calculations divided by the associated degrees of freedom.
  + The degrees of freedom are defined by the number of "independent" values associated with the different calculations.


---
# F-ratio
+ Bigger $F$-ratios indicate better models.
  + It means the model variance is big compared to the residual variance.

--

+ The null hypothesis for the model says that the best guess of any individuals $y$ value is the mean of $y$ plus error.
	+ Or, that the $x$ variables carry no information collectively about $y$.

--

+ $F$-ratio will be close to 1 when the null hypothesis is true
  + If there is equivalent residual to model variation, $F$=1
	+ If there is more model than residual $F$ > 1

--

+ $F$-ratio is then evaluated against an $F$-distribution with $df_{Model}$ and $df_{Residual}$ and a pre-defined $\alpha$

+ We can using model comparison tools. 

---
# $F$-test as an incremental test

+ One important way we can think about the $F$-test and the $F$-ratio is as an incremental test against an "empty" or null model.

+ A null or empty model is a linear model with only the intercept.
  + In this model, our predicted value of the outcome for every case in our data set, is the mean of the outcome.
  + That is, with no predictors, we have no information that may help us predict the outcome.
  + So we will be "least wrong" by guessing the mean of the outcome.

+ An empty model is the same as saying all $\beta$ = 0.

+ So in this way, the $F$-test we have already seen **is comparing two models**.

+ We can extend this idea, and use the $F$-test to compare two models that contain different sets of predictors.
  + This is the **incremental $F$-test**

---

#  Marginal effects 

+ Recall when we have a linear model with multiple predictors, we interpret the $\beta_j$ as the effect "holding all other variables constant".

+ Also note, with interactions, the effect of $x$ on $y$ changes dependent on the value of $z$.
  + More formally, it is the effect of $x$ is conditional on $z$ and vice versa.

+ What this means is that we can no longer talk about holding an effect constant.
  + In the presence of an interaction, by definition, this effect changes.

+ So where as in a linear model without an interaction $\beta_j$ = main effects, with an interaction we refer to **marginal** or **conditional** effects.


---
#  Centering predictors

**Why centre?** 
+ Meaningful interpretation.

  + Interpretation of models with interactions involves evaluation when other variables = 0.
  
  + This makes it quite important that 0 is meaningful in some way.
  	+ Note this is simple with categorical variables.
  	+ We code our reference group as 0 in all dummy variables.
  
  + For continuous variables, we need a meaningful 0 point.

---
#  Example of age 
+ Suppose I have age as a variable in my study with a range of 30 to 85.

+ Age = 0 is not that meaningful.
	+ Essentially means all my parameters are evaluated at point of birth.

+ So what might be meaningful?
	+ Average age? (mean centering)
	+ A fixed point? (e.g. 66 if studying retirement)

+ When the effects of one predictor on the outcome differ across levels of another predictor.

+ Categorical*categorical interaction:
	+ There is a difference in the differences between groups across levels of a second factor.

# Linear model assumptions

---
# Visualizations vs tests
+ There exist a variety of ways to assess assumptions, which broadly split into statistical tests and visualizations.

+ We will focus on visualization:
	+ Easier to see the nature and magnitude of the assumption violation
	+ There is also a very useful function for producing them all.

+ Statistical tests often suggest assumptions are violated when problem is small.
  + This is to do with the statistical power of the tests.
  + Give no information on what the actual problem is.
  + A summary table of tests will be given at the end of the lecture.


---
# Visualizations made easy
+ For a majority of assumption and diagnostic plots, we will make use of the `plot()` function.
  + If we give `plot()` a linear model object (e.g. `m1` or `m2`), we can automatically generate assumption plots.

+ We will also make use of some individual functions for specific visualizations.

+ Alternatively, we can also use `check_model()` from the `performance` package.
  + This provides `ggplot` figures as well as some notes to aid interpretation.
  + Caution that these plots are **not in a format to use directly in reports**

---
#  Linearity 
+ **Assumption**: The relationship between $y$ and $x$ is linear.
  + Assuming a linear relation when the true relation is non-linear can result in under-estimating that relation

#  Non-linearity

+ With multiple predictors, we need to know whether the relations are linear between each predictor and outcome, controlling for the other predictors

+ This can be done using **component-residual plots**
  + Also known as partial-residual plots
		
+ Component-residual plots have the $x$ values on the X-axis and partial residuals on the Y-axis

+ *Partial residuals* for each X variable are:

$$\epsilon_i + B_jX_{ij}$$

#  Independence of errors 
+ **Assumption**: The errors are not correlated with one another

+ Difficult to test unless we know the potential source of correlation between cases.

+ Essentially, if a design is between person, we will assume the errors to be independent.


---
#  Multi-collinearity 
+ This is **not an assumption of linear model**, but it is something we need to consider. 
  + It sits between assumptions and case diagnostics.
  
+ Multi-collinearity refers to the correlation between predictors
  + We saw this in the formula for the standard error of model slopes for an `lm` with multiple predictors.

+ When there are large correlations between predictors, the standard errors are increased
	+ Therefore, we don't want our predictors to be too correlated

---
#  Variance Inflation Factor 
+ The **Variance Inflation Factor** or VIF quantifies the extent to which standard errors are increased by predictor inter-correlations

+ It can be obtained in R using the `vif()` function:

```{r}
vif(m1)
```

+ The function gives a VIF value for each predictor

+ Ideally, we want values to be close to 1

+ VIFs> 10 indicate a problem

---
#  What to do about multi-collinearity 

+ In practice, multi-collinearity is not often a major problem

+ When issues arise, consider:
	+ Combining highly correlated predictors into a single composite
		  + E.g. create a sum or average of the two predictors
	+ Dropping an IV that is obviously statistically and conceptually redundant with another from the model

#  Three important features

+ Model outliers
	+ Cases for which there is a large discrepancy between their predicted value ( $\hat{y_i}$ ) and their observed value ( $y_i$ )

--

+ High leverage cases
	+ Cases with an unusual value of the predictor ( $x_i$ )

--

+ High influence cases
	+ Cases who are having a large impact on the estimation of model

---
#  Influence

+ High leverage cases, when they are also linear model outliers, will have high **influence**

+ Cases with high influence, have a strong effect on the coefficients

+ If we deleted such a case, the linear model coefficients would change substantially


---
# Influence

+ If a handful of influential cases are responsible for the linear model results, the conclusions might not generalise very well

+ Multiple ways to consider influence.
  + Here we will discuss Cook's distance.
  
+ Cook's Distance of a data point $i$ (can be written many ways):


$$D_i = \frac{(\text{StandardizedResidual}_i)^2}{k+1} \times \frac{h_i}{1-h_i}$$

---
#  Cooks Distance 
$$\frac{(\text{StandardizedResidual}_i)^2}{k+1} = \text{Outlyingness}$$


$$\frac{h_i}{1-h_i} = \text{Leverage}$$

+ So $D_i = \text{Outlyingness} \times \text{Leverage}$


+ Cook's distance refers to **the average distance the $\hat{y}$ values will move if a given case is removed.**
  + If removing one case changes the predicted values a lot (moves the regression line), then that case is influencing our results.

---
#  Cooks Distance 

+ Many different suggestions for cut-off's:
  + $D_i > 1$ 
  + $D_i > \frac{4}{n-k-1}$
  + Or size relative all values in data set

#  Cook's distance in R

.pull-left[
```{r}
salary2 %>%
  mutate(
    cook = cooks.distance(m1) #<<
  ) %>%
  filter(., cook > 4/(100-3-1)) %>% #<<
  kable(.)  %>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F}
plot(m1, which = 4)

# Influence of coefficients
+ Cook's distance is a single value summarizing the total influence of a case

+ In the context of a lm with 2+ predictors, we may want to look in a little more detail.

+ **DFFit**: The difference between the predicted outcome value for a case with versus without a case included

+ **DFbeta**: The difference between the value for a coefficient with and without a case included

+ **DFbetas**: A standardised version of DFbeta
  + Obtained by dividing by an estimate of the standard error of the regression coefficient with the case removed

---
#  COVRATIO 
+ Influence on standard errors can be measured using the **COVRATIO** statistic
	+ COVRATIO value <1 show that precision is decreased (SE increased)  by a case
	+ COVRATIO value >1 show that precision is increased (SE decreased) by a case

+ Cases with COVRATIOS $> 1+[3(k +1)/n]$ or $< 1-[3( k +1)/ n ]$ can be considered to have a strong influence on the standard errors

---
#  COVRATIO in R 
+ COVRATIO values can be extracted using the `covratio()` function:
+ We can extract these measures using the `influence.measures()` function
