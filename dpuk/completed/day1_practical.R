# Vectors
# =======

# Create a vector with the c (short for combine) function
c(1, 3, 5)
c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

# sequence from 1 to 10
seq(10, 15)
seq(10, 15, by = 1)

# from:to is a short for seq(from, to, by = 1)
10:15

# you can combine vectors
c(1:4, 10)

# in steps of 2
seq(1, 10, by = 2)

# five equally spaced numbers
seq(0, 10, length.out = 5)


# Assign variables / objects
# ==========================

# Variable = named cell of the computer's memory 
# that can store different values

# Assign = store the result of a computation into a variable

# To assign the result of a computation to a variable, use the assignment 
# operator name <- log(10)

# What will R print?

# Subsetting / indexing
# =====================

# Specify the elements you want within square brackets []
# positive integer = keep
# negative integer = exclude
# TRUE = keep, FALSE = exclude

# Numeric subsetting

# Reading data
# ============

# Imagine a study into income disparity for workers in a local authority. 
# We might carry out interviews and find that there is a link between the level of 
# education and an employee's income. Those with more formal education seem to be 
# better paid. Now we wouldn't have time to interview everyone who works for 
# the local authority so we would have to interview a sample, say 10%.
# We will use the riverview data (see below) to examine whether education level 
# is related to income among the employees working for the city of Riverview, 
# a hypothetical midwestern city in the US.

# The riverview data come from Lewis-Beck and Lewis-Beck (2015) and contain  
# data collected from a random sample of n = 32 employees working for the 
# city of Riverview, a hypothetical midwestern city in the US. 

# The attributes include:
#   + education: Years of formal education
#   + income: Annual income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)
#   + seniority: Years of seniority
#   + gender: Employee's gender
#   + male: Dummy coded gender variable (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
#   + party: Political party affiliation

# 3. Write down an interpretation of the model results. This typically includes a
# few sentences about the coefficients.

# We can interpret the estimated intercept as follows:
# The estimated average income associated to zero years of formal education is 
# $11,321.

# For the estimated slope we might write:
# The estimated increase in average income associated to a one year increase in 
# education is $2,651.


# 4. Create a plot of the line. 
# Hint: geom_abline(intercept = ?, slope = ?)

#### PRACTICE ####

# 1. Locate the path to the DPUK data file on the shared folder. 
# Read the data into R using that path.

# 2. Choose a numeric variable to be the outcome, and another to be the 
# explanatory variable. Fit a linear model that uses the explanatory variable 
# to predict the outcome.

# 3. Write down an interpretation of the model results. This typically includes a
# few sentences about the coefficients.

# 4. Create a plot of the line. 
# Hint: geom_abline(intercept = ?, slope = ?)
